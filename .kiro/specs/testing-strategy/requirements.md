# Testing Strategy Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive testing strategy for the Lingua language learning app. The strategy will ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability while providing confidence in the application's functionality across all user workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust component testing framework, so that I can verify individual components work correctly in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is tested THEN the testing framework SHALL render the component with all required props
2. WHEN component interactions occur THEN the framework SHALL simulate user events accurately
3. WHEN component state changes THEN the framework SHALL verify the correct UI updates
4. WHEN components have dependencies THEN the framework SHALL provide mocking capabilities
5. WHEN tests run THEN the framework SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 2: Integration Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for critical user workflows, so that I can ensure different parts of the application work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing user authentication THEN the system SHALL verify login/logout workflows end-to-end
2. WHEN testing note management THEN the system SHALL verify create/read/update/delete operations
3. WHEN testing navigation THEN the system SHALL verify routing and protected routes work correctly
4. WHEN testing data persistence THEN the system SHALL verify Supabase integration functions properly
5. WHEN testing state management THEN the system SHALL verify Redux store updates propagate correctly

### Requirement 3: Test Organization and Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-organized test files, so that I can easily locate, maintain, and extend tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent file naming convention
2. WHEN structuring test suites THEN the system SHALL group related tests logically
3. WHEN writing test descriptions THEN the system SHALL use clear, descriptive names
4. WHEN creating test utilities THEN the system SHALL provide reusable helper functions
5. WHEN documenting tests THEN the system SHALL include setup and teardown procedures

### Requirement 4: Mocking and Test Data Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent mocking strategies, so that tests are reliable and don't depend on external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing components with API calls THEN the system SHALL mock external dependencies
2. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL mock Supabase auth responses
3. WHEN testing navigation THEN the system SHALL mock React Router functions
4. WHEN creating test data THEN the system SHALL provide factory functions for consistent data
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL ensure tests are isolated and don't affect each other

### Requirement 5: Performance and Accessibility Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and accessibility tests, so that the application meets quality standards for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL verify accessibility attributes are present
2. WHEN testing forms THEN the system SHALL verify keyboard navigation works correctly
3. WHEN testing loading states THEN the system SHALL verify appropriate loading indicators
4. WHEN testing responsive design THEN the system SHALL verify components work on different screen sizes
5. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL identify components that render inefficiently

### Requirement 6: Continuous Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test execution, so that code quality is maintained throughout development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run all unit tests automatically
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent code deployment
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports
4. WHEN coverage drops THEN the system SHALL alert developers
5. WHEN running tests in CI THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Edge Case Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling tests, so that the application gracefully handles unexpected situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL handle offline scenarios
3. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate and reject it
4. WHEN components receive unexpected props THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully
5. WHEN user sessions expire THEN the system SHALL redirect to authentication

### Requirement 8: Test Coverage and Quality Metrics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want measurable test coverage, so that I can ensure adequate testing of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring coverage THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 80% line coverage
2. WHEN measuring coverage THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 70% branch coverage
3. WHEN identifying untested code THEN the system SHALL highlight areas needing tests
4. WHEN running quality checks THEN the system SHALL verify test quality metrics
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide actionable coverage insights
